    "Well, Ansatz referes to the quantum machine learning process and mainly it is about the variational quantum circuits. To deal with this problem I would like to start with the main three blocks that we have in a quantum device. First block is **encoding block** which we encod classical data to the quantum states. The second block is **Quantum model** which can either be *deterministic* or *variationl*. In this case we are dealing with **variational quantum model**. And the last block is our measurment block that the output tells us how much we are close to the true anwere.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example I would say that we can start with a bunch of qubits in random states and then apply various type of trainable-gates over them and following that we have measurment like the expection value of an operator. Then by comparison the measurment result by the true value and calculation the cost function we understand how we should train the gates in order to reach the zero value for cost function.\n",

    "In this problem we just need to design an **Ansatz class** with specific constraints and requirements. \n",
    "* we need a class to represnt the states of qunatum system which involve multiple layers, where each layer contain a list of gates.\n",
    "* we have a constrain about layer which each layer can contain multiple gates, but there should be no overlap between gates in a layer. Only 1- and 2-qubit gates are allowed\n",
    "* we shoud achieves functional requirements like: fast access to the first available layer, fast iteration qubit-by-qubit, and fast iteration layer-by-layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How would you actually implement your design? Please show relevant code snippets.**\n",
