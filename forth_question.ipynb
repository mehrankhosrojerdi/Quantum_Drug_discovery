    "* According to the error that is arrised in your implementation I would say that we have key point that help us to solve this issue. The **ValueError: Input operator is not Hermitian** tells us that te problem comes from the non Hermitian formation of the operator. \n",
    "* Then using a Hermition operator we can solve this issue. Based on the error I would say that this error is raised during the evaluation of the operator in **qiskit_aer** inside the **save_expectation_value.py**. \n",
    "* Moreover this error tells us that the first error raised in **estimate_observables** function, where we do calculation over **expectation_values**\n",

    "Some hints that you should consider in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. make sure that you are using the hermition operatior\n",
    "2. you can define a function to figure out is youe operator hermition or no.\n",
    "3. Based on your code if you are transfering from spin systems to the creation and annihilation or vise versa one using **Jordan wigner transformation** you should be careful about result which has to be Hermitian."
