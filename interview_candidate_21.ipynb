    "Well, Ansatz referes to the quantum machine learning process and mainly it is about the variational quantum circuits. To deal with this problem I would like to start with the main three blocks that we have in a quantum device. First block is **encoding block** which we encod classical data to the quantum states. The second block is **Quantum model** which can either be *deterministic* or *variationl*. In this case we are dealing with **variational quantum model**. And the last block is our measurment block that the output tells us how much we are close to the true anwere.\n",

Then by comparison the measurment result by the true value and calculation the cost function we understand how we should train the gates in order to reach the zero value for cost function.\n",
